# Fun Python Scripts
Variety of mostly completely useless and redundant scripts made for fun in Python. Most of them were made long ago, *circa* 2013.

## Table of Contents
+ **advent_code_one.py** and **advent_code_two.py** - Two scripts made for the Advent of Code 2019 event.
+ **algorithms_quiz.py** - Quiz for Algorithms' test.
+ **beep_boop.py** - Simple app with purpose to annoy the user with its sounds.
+ **calculate_sequence_easy.py** - Based on the first and second element of the sequence, calculate any element of the sequence.
+ **drawing_stuff.py** - Drawing squares using turtle. Nothing special really.
+ **lottery_winnings_calculator.py** - Calculator made for fun to figure out, hypothetically, how much money can a person spend monthly to live until retirement with the lottery money evenly distributed across months.
+ **router_setup_helper.py** - Never finished script that intended to help configure a Cisco router.
+ **simple_timer.py** - Very obscure, crude and simple timer. Works only on Windows.
+ **text_game_rpg.py** - RPG text-based game that was abandoned early. Only first stage exists and it's very crude. Also, terrible coding inside!
+ **wise_pick.py** - Dota 2 app that gives verbose advice about picking heroes in Dota. It was useless then and even more useless now, since meta in Dota 2 changes rapidly. One of the oldest of my Python scripts.
